## Results

Notable results include:
* [Graph-based segmentation](https://github.com/RomanJuranek/graph-segmentation) for microscopy which is now actually part of commercial product
* Lightweight library for image rectification - [librectify](https://github.com/RomanJuranek/librectify) which is used in Zoner Photo Studio.

I am also author of Python implementation of [WaldBoost](https://github.com/RomanJuranek/librectify) trainig algorithm which support features required for implementation of object detection in FPGA. And there are some support Python packages for geometry processing - `pclines-python`, `diamond-space` and `bbx`.
